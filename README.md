Main Problem <br>

In this case we are given a set of coins whose amount can be vary. The set of coins is 5c, 10c, 20c, 50c, $1, and $2.
The problem is we need to find the minimum number of coins that change hands. If we need to pay 55c, and we do not hold
a 50c coin, we could pay this as 2 Ã— 20c + 10c + 5c to make a total of 4 coins. If we tender $1 we will
receive 45c in change which also involves 4 coins, but if we tender $1.05 ($1 + 5c), we get 50c change
and the total number of coins that changes hands is only 3 so the minimum number of coins that change hands was 3.

Sample Input

2 4 2 0 1 0  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 0.55 <br>
0 0 0 0 0 0 <br>

Greedy Solution Explaination <br>

First we need to make a index for all the coins. After input we are going to loop the 


After testing the output of greedy there is differences in the output because greedy solution only looking for the most optimal in that time so the output won't be maximal.
Dynamic Programming Explaination <br>

For Dynamic programing after input first we are going  to set the value with inside the array to be compared <br>
for(int i=1; i<maxValue; i++) ways[i] = limit; <br>
after that we are going to loop nad compare all the value in the array and overwrite the value with the possible cents<br>
<br>   if(ways[j] < limit) <br>
{ ways[j + coinsCents[i]] = min(ways[j]+1, ways[j+coinsCents[i]]);} <br>
 
 after overwrite it with possible coins than we are going to compare the coins given and output the answer. <br> <br>
 for(int i = coinCents; i<maxValue; i++) <br>
 { answer = min(answer, ways[i] + minimumChange(i - coinCents, coinsCents)); } <br> cout<<answer<<endl; <br>
